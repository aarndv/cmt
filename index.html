            Dear cm,
          </p>
          <p>
            I do very much appreciate you as well. Even if I’m quite awkward in person (really), what I say is what I mean (except for the times I kid around of course !!). And of course, congratulationss for both school years. I’m proud of what you’ve accomplished! I told very few people about this, but it’s more relevant now. Starting my journey in FEU HS required me to choose between a school that I know a lot of people or a school with fresh new faces (FEU HS). Looking back I’m very glad that I did, because I’ve met a lot of wonderful people, some even go beyond my expectations. That of course, you’re included in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, you gave me two choices and ‘di ka rin naman manhid. So, you already know which of the two. Actually, to be honest with you, it already died a few months ago and it’s nobody's fault, well of course that time it wasn’t a bad thing, kasi I got over you. But the past few weeks, you’ve single handedly revived that, I’m literally in awe regarding how you even managed to do that. Back then, when you’re asking for the confirmation to your debut, I kept constantly reminding myself na it was already over and attending it will be kind of awkward for me, especially if I don’t know anybody else there. But as you know I did eventually agree on going, not because I was slowly transitioning again, no not all. It's because it’s kind of disrespectful na rin not to go yk. But you know I’m glad that I did, each talk with you constantly pushed me.

            And yes, to say it in words. I like you too. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn’t say anything about it but the first time I talked to you in discord (last year with Ralph), I genuinely thought your voice sounded nice, legit, but in a “compliment” way.
          </p>
          <p>
            You know, I couldn’t say it before, pero I really appreciate you taking notes of all my specific wants and all. But to be honest with you, I only keep track of those very meticulously to the people I cherish, so no, I don’t do it to everyone. It’s a habit that I’ve learned before that I’ve continued on. 
          </p>
          <p>
            For all the little things that you try to do, even though nahahalata ko, I appreciate it so much! I have many more things to say, pero I can’t fit everything here tonight. I’ll tell more of the background soon, maybe in casual talk or a follow up. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m all for seeing you healed and happy. That's what matters.
